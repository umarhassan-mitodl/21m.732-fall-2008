Lecture: Translating Emotion to Visual

Visual conversation exercise

Line/Emotion exercise

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

### Translating emotion to visual

Cards are layed out that feature photos of different colors and textures. Students choose an emotion from a list and them assemble a group of cards of their choice to represent that emotion. We then try and determine which emotions are represented. Each student talks aboout why they made their choices and hears feedback from the group.

The use of cards in this exercise is adapted from Tiala, Crystal. "Teaching Visual Communication: Using Image Cards as a Teaching Tool." *Theatre Design & Technology* 39 (Winter 2003): 10-16.
